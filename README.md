<h1>PsyPy: An application employing Python based Machine Learning methods for data analysis of Psychiatric diseases (2022) </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This project aimed to explore the use of machine learning methods in psychiatry and their applications in diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. PsyPy is a valuable tool that has the potential to benefit researchers, clinicians, and students by improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment selection, by automatically selecting the optimum ML method for data analysis and interpretation. The program depends on external data in the form of input provided by the user and external libraries or packages used in different machine learning methods.
  Undertaken as a graduate certificate student at University of North Carolina, USA.
